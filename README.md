# Interference 3D
A simple 3D simulation of waves propagating and interfering on a flat surface. (Three.js + UI)

## Installation 
To install this software you only need to download the **Interference 3D** folder and to run the **index.html** file on your browser.

## Usage
The program provides you with a **field** which the waves are simulated on. <br>
Using the **field menue** on the right you can control the field size, the wave velocity and the animation settings. <br>
The **wave sources menue** on the left allows you to set the positions of the wave sources and their physical parameters. <br>
The simulation can also be controlled by the **play/pause**, **back-to-start** and the **slower** buttons below.
